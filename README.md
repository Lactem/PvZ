PvZ
===

Plants Versus Zombies is a minecraft mini-game inspired by the popular Android/iOS game. Check out the plugin at http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/plants-vs-zombies/!
If you would like to contribute to the project, please use Java 7, as PvZ is built on that version because not all servers have updated to Java 8 yet.
