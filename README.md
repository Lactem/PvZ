PvZ
===

Plants Versus Zombies is a minecraft mini-game inspired by the popular Android/iOS game. The plugin can be downloaded by compiling or by visiting http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/plants-vs-zombies/! This project uses the MIT license os that all can feel free to contribute to the project. Please use Java 7, as PvZ is built on that version because many servers have updated to Java 8 yet.
